          <p>
            Hey you guys! My name is EJ Gonzalez, I am 19 years old and I
            created Lost Puppers. The reason I created this site is that I saw
            there were no dedicated sites to helping people find their lost
            dogs. As an owner of 3 dogs and two running away at one point, I
            know how scary it can be to lose your dog. I am hoping that through
            this site, the community can come together to help each other find
            their lost pets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lost Puppers was first initiated as a project for a coding boot
            camp, but is now available for everyone to use. If you ever lose a
            pup or have found one this is the site to come to. It is dedicated
            to helping families reunite with their lost puppies. We all know how
            scary it can be to come home and find your dog missing. Take your
            first steps now by signing up and if this site was able to help you
            please feel free to donate.
          </p>
